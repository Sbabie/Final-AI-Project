Here are three key visuals for your SDG 13: Climate Action pitch deck:

1. **Energy Use vs CO₂ Emissions** – Shows a clear positive correlation: as energy use increases, CO₂ emissions generally rise.
2. **Renewable Energy % vs CO₂ Emissions** – Displays a negative trend: higher renewable energy usage often correlates with lower CO₂ emissions.
3. **Urban Population % vs CO₂ Emissions** – Indicates how urbanization may impact emissions, potentially useful for policy discussions.
